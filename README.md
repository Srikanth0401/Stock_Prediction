# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in PyTorch. It utilizes historical stock data sourced from Alpha Vantage to forecast future prices.

## Features
- **LSTM Network**: Captures temporal patterns in time series data.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical stock data via the Alpha Vantage API.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
